# zijela_music

This is the source code for https://music.zijela.com I am calling on collaborator to help make this project better.
Features that I intend to add are:
1. Rewriting the project entirely in React.Js and node.js
2. Adding a mongo db for storing playlists and user preferences.
3. Adding music creator-fan chat capabilities
4  Adding a newsfeed and livestreaming capabilities for singers
5. Adding a recording option for saving unproduced music
